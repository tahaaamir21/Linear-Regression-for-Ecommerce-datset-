This project implements a linear regression model to predict the yearly amount spent by e-commerce customers. The notebook includes:

*   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer features using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
*   Model training using scikit-learn's LinearRegression.
*   Model evaluation using mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and residual analysis.
*   Visualization of model performance using joint plots and probability plots.

The aim is to identify key factors influencing customer spending and build a predictive model for business insights.
